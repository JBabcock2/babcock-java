Programming has proven to be very difficult at times but I am very satisified when I complete a working assignment. I plan on obtaining a degree in Computer Programming at Grand Canyon University and eventually becoming a software developer at a large firm. The reason I chose this degree is because programming has always intrigued me, being able to tell a computer what to do is what many companies need to stay ahead of their competition. Working at USAA, I have learned about the level of technology used to keep up with the leading insurance providers. Outside of school and work, I really enjoy shooting, golfing, biking, running, and camping. WheneverI am stressed, shooting off a couple of roundsis surpisingly relaxing, especially when you use larger weapons. The biggest gun I have shotten so far was a fifty caliber heavy machine gun.
